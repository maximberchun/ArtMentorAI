"""
The `services` package contains the business logic of the API.

This package typically includes:
- Service classes and functions that implement the domain rules.
- Validation and transformation of data beyond simple schema checks.
- Operations that represent use cases or workflows of the application.

Files placed here should focus on implementing the core behavior of the
application, independent from technical details such as HTTP requests,
database drivers, or framework-specific code.
