"""
The `core` package contains the fundamental building blocks of the API.

This package typically includes:
- Logging setup and monitoring utilities.
- Dependency injection or application startup utilities.
- Middleware or shared infrastructure components.

Files placed here should define the essential infrastructure that the
rest of the application depends on, but should remain independent from
the business logic of specific modules.
